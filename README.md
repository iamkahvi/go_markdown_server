# kahvi's notepad

my effort at building google docs but it's one doc and it's markdown.

some features:
- client
  - v1: photo to text feature
  - v1: browser based
  - v1: works on my boox go e-reader
- server
  - v1: doesn't allow >1 clients
  - v2: opens a separate file per client if they're editing it at once
    - or it gives you the option to boot someone else off
